          "On the historical timeline of personal transportation vehicles – horses on one end, and, say, Segways on the other – automobiles and bicycles have been the dominant warring tribes of public streets for nearly a century. Despite all the cars taking up so much room, though, there’s more bicycles than anything else in the world: more than a billion, as estimated by Worldometers, and nine million in Beijing, according to folk singer <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Million_Bicycles\">Katie Melua</a>, where bicycling accounts for 32% of all trips.",
          "While most jurisdictions allow bicycles to share the road with motor vehicles (“A person riding a bicycle… has all the rights and is subject to all the provisions applicable to the driver of a vehicle” <a href=\"http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=veh&group=21001-22000&file=21200-21212\">says the California Vehicle Code</a>, in one particular instance) it goes without saying that most cyclists prefer to be in their own lane. It’s safer, for one thing. And because it’s safer, it actually encourages more bikers. And more bikers means healthier citizens, reduced carbon emissions, higher traffic throughput, and congestion mitigation. The <a href=\"http://pdxcityclub.org/2013/Report/Portland-Bicycle-Transit/Economic-Effects-of-Increased-Bicycle-Usage\">economic benefits accrue as well</a>: less money spent on automobile infrastructure (like bridges, roadways, and parking), and with the ability to fit more people on a road, it leads to more business in commercial corridors.",
          "Bike lane design can be extremely varied. Using medians, planters, bollards, or even parking lanes create better protection between bikes and cars. When lanes are painted green, it shows their city’s commitment to a continuous bike lane, and synchronized signal light timing to limit bike stops are called a “green wave.” For more information, check out the <a href=\"http://nacto.org/cities-for-cycling/design-guide/\">NACTO Urban Bikeway Design Guide</a>."

The problem: motorists aren’t always completely aware of cyclists. The solution: make cyclists as visible as possible. And one strategy for this is to make bike lanes a totally different color than the rest of the asphalt.",

The United Kingdom has a mixture of red and green, and most municipalities in the United States ended up going green (by accident: they all just copied each other), though Portland, one of the most bike-friendly cities in the U.S., have been using <a href=\"http://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/58842\">blue lanes since the 1990s</a>.",
              "No matter which color you like best, the general rule of thumb is to pick something that sticks out and doesn’t look like other lane markings in your area. Beyond that, the more pressing budgetary concern for most cities is maintenance. Right now, the most commonly used type of paint dulls and wears off fairly quickly, although new improvements in paint are starting to make it more durable. But if recurring costs are a significant concern, don’t let that outweigh the safety benefits: you might want to consider an up-front cost in the form of <a href=\"http://nacto.org/bufferedlane.html‎\">protective barriers</a>, instead."
